I had a much older sister who killed herself when I was 6. She was 26 when she died. All of her stuff is in the basement in boxes. I don't remember too much about her honestly and it makes me sad sometimes. My parents don't talk much about her. There's a painting in our house that she painted. It's a very nice painting of a swamp. It's my favorite thing. I decided to go looking through all of her stuff mostly for more pictures. What I found was a bunch of notebooks of writing she did mostly poetry. I felt weird reading them at first because they were mostly about her depression then I read this one that was about how she had a baby and someone took him away. It's really short and I didn't really understand it like a lot of it seemed metaphorical I guess is the word. Anyways I asked my mom if she ever had a baby and my mom was real weird about it she wanted to know why I would ask that. I said idk I just found some stuff in the basement and was curious. She got real mad at me and told me not to snoop and said she didn't have kids. Well I started thinking about it. I am the spitting image of my sister but I don't look like my mom or dad. I casually asked my mom to see my birth certificate the next day and she got mad again and wouldn't let me see it.\",\n        date: (new Date()).toDateString(),\n        title: \"Reddit6\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 7,\n        text: \"Hi, I'm 16 y/o and have good reason to think my mom and dad aren't my real parents.
